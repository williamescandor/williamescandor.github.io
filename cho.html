		<h3>Favorite CMSC subject:</h3> 
		CMSC 22. Why CMSC 22? Because object-oriented programming languages are fun to deal with.
		<br>
		<h3>Favorite Food:</h3>
		 Definitely Sisig. I generally hate oily foods, but this is an exception to the rule. The way the meat crunches then melts in the mouth is something you'd never have enough of. Especially if it has a mix of chili and calamansi.

		<h3>About Myself:</h3> 
		Born and raised in the Philippines, and although I carry foreign blood, I have never left outside of the country. I like music, games, and sleep... I really don't know what more you'd want to know.
		<br>
		<h3>Expectations:</h3> 
		Besides being able to learn, I would want to be more proficient in creating websites. This, I think, would be more of an expectation to myself, so honestly none
